Credit Summary
Your Equifax Credit Summary highlights the information in your credit file that is most important in determining your credit standing by
distilling key credit information into one easy-to-read summary.
Accounts
Lenders usually take a positive view of individuals with a range of credit accounts - car loan, credit cards, mortgage, etc. - that have a
record of timely payments. However, a high debt to credit ratio on certain types of revolving (credit card) accounts and installment
loans will typically have a negative impact.

Account Age
Usually, it is a good idea to keep your oldest credit account open, as a high average account age generally demonstrates stability to
lenders. Also, especially if you have been managing credit for a short time, opening many new accounts will lower your average
account age and may have a negative impact.

Inquiries - Requests for your Credit History
Numerous inquiries on your credit file for new credit may cause you to appear risky to lenders, so it is usually better to only seek new
credit when you need it. Typically, lenders distinguish between inquiries for a single loan and many new loans in part by the length of
time over which the inquiries occur. So, when rate shopping for a loan it's a good idea to do it within a focused period of time.

Potentially Negative Information
Late payments, collections and public records can have a negative impact on your credit standing. The more severe and recent they
are, the more negative the potential impact might be.
