## üöÄ **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Initialize Git Branching Structure**

```bash
# Ensure you're in the JAM Website directory
cd "JAM Website"

# Check current branch
git branch

# Create and setup development branch
git checkout -b development
git push -u origin development

# Create and setup staging branch
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging

# Return to main
git checkout main
```

### **2. Configure Branch Protection (GitHub Web Interface)**

**Go to:** GitHub Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches

**Main Branch:**

1. Click "Add rule"
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"
4. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
5. Enable "Include administrators"
6. Save changes

**Staging Branch:**

1. Click "Add rule"
2. Branch name pattern: `staging`
3. Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"
4. Save changes

### **3. Setup Automatic Deployments**

**GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):**

```yaml
name: JAM Capital CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging, development]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, staging, development]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd Backend && npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd Backend && npm test

  deploy-production:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: echo "Deploy to jam-capital-backend.azurewebsites.net"

  deploy-staging:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: echo "Deploy to jam-capital-staging.azurewebsites.net"
```

## üìã **BRANCH NAMING CONVENTIONS**

### **Feature Branches**

```bash
feature/user-authentication-improvement
feature/ghl-payment-integration
feature/dashboard-performance-optimization
feature/security-enhancement
```

### **Hotfix Branches**

```bash
hotfix/critical-payment-bug
hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/database-connection-issue
```

### **Release Branches**

```bash
release/v1.2.0
release/v1.2.1-hotfix
release/major-update-v2.0.0
```

---

## üî• **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **Production Hotfix Workflow**

```bash
# For critical production issues

# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description

# 2. Fix the issue quickly
# Edit files, test locally

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical payment processing issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue-description

# 4. Create PR directly to main (emergency)
# Merge immediately after review

# 5. Also merge back to development and staging
git checkout development
git merge main
git checkout staging
git merge main
```

### **Rollback Procedure**

```bash
# If production deployment fails

# 1. Quick rollback to previous commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back 1 commit
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# 2. Or rollback to specific version
git checkout main
git reset --hard <previous-good-commit-hash>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## üìä **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Adding New Feature**

```bash
# Week 1: Start feature
git checkout development
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-user-dashboard
# Develop and test locally

# Week 1 End: Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/enhanced-user-dashboard
# Create PR to development

# Week 2: After PR approval
git checkout development  # Switch to development
git pull origin development  # Get latest including your merged feature

# Week 2: Deploy to staging for testing
git checkout staging
git merge development
git push origin staging  # Auto-deploys to staging

# Week 2 End: After staging testing passes
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to production
```

### **Example 2: Multiple Developers**

```bash
# Developer A working on authentication
git checkout -b feature/auth-improvements

# Developer B working on payments
git checkout -b feature/payment-enhancements

# Both merge to development independently
# Both features tested together in staging
# Both deployed to production together
```
