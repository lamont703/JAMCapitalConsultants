## **OVERVIEW: Development â†’ Staging â†’ Production Strategy**

You now have a **complete development environment strategy** that safely separates your development work from production, with proper Git workflow and environment management.

```

# From JAM Website root directory
./scripts/setup-development-environment.sh

# Configure your development credentials
cd Backend
cp env-templates/development.env.template .env.development
# Edit .env.development with development credentials
```

### **2. Setup Git Branching (5 minutes)**
```bash
# From JAM Website root directory  
./scripts/setup-git-branches.sh
```

### **3. Test Your Setup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Test development environment
cd Backend
npm run dev  # Start development server

# Test production systems
node production-systems-test.js
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ **DAILY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Morning Routine**
```bash
# 1. Get latest changes
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# 2. Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Start development server
cd Backend
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### **Development Process**
```bash
# 4. Make changes and test locally
# Edit your files...
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health  # Test endpoint

# 5. Commit and push feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **Integration & Deployment**
```bash
# 6. Create PR on GitHub: feature/your-feature-name â†’ development
# After approval and merge:

# 7. Deploy to staging for testing
git checkout staging
git merge development
git push origin staging  # Auto-deploys to staging

# 8. Test on staging environment
# Verify everything works on staging.jamcapitalconsultants.com

# 9. Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to production
```

This setup ensures you can develop, test, and deploy safely without affecting your live production environment!
